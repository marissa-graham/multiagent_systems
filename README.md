Supporting code for assignments in my multiagent systems class (excluding assignments where that just meant basic scratch code, obviously).

Specs for all assignments were given in terms of high-level objectives (no implementation details specified) and assignments were graded solely on their writeup (no code was turned in for either homeworks or labs). Writeups can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oQzXiXiRqboGXID-IAfiiPkQgy9xuPZI.

These are a good demonstration of my current (as of January 2019) habits with respect to documentation, code style and organization, class usage, and implementation of bits of math. I also figured out how to do a lot of new things in Matplotlib during this semester and the figures included in these files are good demos for that.

TODO: Go back and add the instructions or at least a short description of the objective for 
* Lab 3
* Lab 2
* Lab 1
* Consensus and Topology
* Fictitious Play
