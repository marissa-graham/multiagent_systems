Supporting code for assignments in my multiagent systems class.

Specs for all assignments were given in terms of high-level objectives with no implementation details, and assignments were graded solely on their writeup. Typically the assignment spec was to model something, then find and analyze interesting results. My writeups can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oQzXiXiRqboGXID-IAfiiPkQgy9xuPZI. Some assignments were done in pairs or groups, but any document owned by me is entirely my writing.

These are a good demonstration of my current (as of January 2019) default coding habits with respect to documentation, code style and organization, class usage, and implementation of bits of math. I also figured out how to do a lot of new things in Matplotlib during this semester and the figures included in these files are good demos for that.

TODO: Go back and add the instructions for each assignment or at least a short description of the objective.
